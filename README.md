# Baldurs Gate 3 Mods

## Path of the Giant - Barbarian Subclass
A close to faithful adaptation of the Path of the Giant Barbarian subclass from Glory of the Giants.

The follow changes were necessary:

- Druidcraft: Did not exist in-game previously. Grants advantage on Animal Handling and Survival checks. This spell has also been added to the Druid spell list.
- Crushing Throw: As rage damage is already applied to thrown weapons, this has been changed to Crushing Strike which adds your rage damage again to melee attacks and thrown weapon attacks.
- Demiurgic Colossus: Instead of adding this ability as part of the subclass progression, it has been converted into equipment. Look for the Crown of the Demiurge in act 3 and earn this capstone.

### Progression
#### Level 3
Giant's Power: You gain your choice of Druidcraft or Thaumaturgy.

Giant's Havoc: When you rage you grow to size Large, your reach increases by 1.5m/5ft and you deal additional damage with melee attacks and thrown weapon attacks.

#### Level 6
Giant's Havoc: Elemental: When you enter your rage, choose one of the following damage types: Acid, Cold, Fire, Thunder, Lightning. Your weapon becomes an Elemental Cleaver, gaining the thrown property, returning to you when thrown, and dealing an additional 1d6 damage of the chosen type.

Elemental Cleaver: As a bonus action while holding your Elemental Cleaver, you can change the damage type of your Elemental Cleaver.

#### Level 10
Mighty Impel: As a bonus action, throw a creature that is smaller than you. Allies will not take damage or be knocked over. All other creatures must make a Strength Saving Throw with a DC of 10+PB+your Strength Modifier.

### Known Issues
When weapons are thrown they appear to lose conditions and will not appear to have any associated VFX. The conditions are still there and will appear again at the start of your next turn. If your Elemental Cleaver appears to stop working after being thrown, do not worry. This appears to be a bug with the engine itself.

The Saving Throw of Mighty Impel does not always appear. Due to how throws are interrupted, it will only appear on a success if a saving throw is involved. This is in contrast to when a player can normally throw light creatures as that is an ability check on the player's side.
